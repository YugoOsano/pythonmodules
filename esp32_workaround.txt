toolchain was downloaded from:
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/windows-setup.html

setup was done according to:
https://qiita.com/rukihena/items/d226972972a360fc2648

make menuconfig doesn't work:
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/1703

to check default serial port:
launch the device manager 
-> initially no device driver for Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART bridge
-> update the driver
-> then the port number will be automatically assigned (COM3)

To add IDF_PATH on opening mingw32,
create a file:
C:\msys32\etc\profile.d\add_IDF_PATH.sh

with its text:
export IDF_PATH="/c/esp-idf"

On mingw32.exe:

ESP IDF's path is verified by:
# printenv IDF_PATH

Copy an example project to the current directory:
cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world .

on the project directory (like hello_world):
run the setup tool by
# make menuconfig

to specify the serial port as COM3 (as shown in device manager)

Therein, set serial port as

/dev/COM3 (from /dev/tty...) under Serial Flasher Options.

build and transfer the binary by:

# make flash

here, some process conflict may happen with errors of permission denied on fork, execvp, and so on.
In such a case, close other Windows application and simply retype make flash.

Message of serial port connecting.. wrote *** bytes to ... Leaving ...
means binary transferred successfully.

To see the binary running,

# make monitor

------------------------
[WiFi]
The ESP32 can act as a WiFi station; as it doesn't connect to a wired network,
it is called soft AP (Access Point)

Copy an example project to the current directory:
cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/wifi/getting-started/softAP .

As in README.md, set SSID and password, then build by:
# make (-j*) flash

Then SSID will come up on available network from any devices.
To see the binary running,

# make monitor

Stop by Ctrl+H

xxx installed esptool on WSL by:
xxx $ sudo pip3 install esptool
-> the serial port was not recognized on WSL; worked on mingw32 instead.

install verified by:
# which esptool.py

# export PORT=/dev/COM3
# export BAUD=115200

To clear the flash memory,
# esptool.py --chip esp32 -p $PORT -b $BAUD erase_flash

Go to Micropython page to download:
http://micropython.org/download/

In 2020 Sep, downloaded:
esp32-idf3-20200902-v1.13.bin
to the mingw current directory.

Transfer this binary to esp32 by:
# esptool.py --chip esp32 --port $PORT --baud 115200 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-idf3-20200902-v1.13.bin

Use TeraTerm on Windows instead of picocom on Linux
-> select Serial radio button on start
-> Go to Setup->serial to adjust baud rate (Speed) from 9600 to 115200
  -> Press [New Setting]
-> Go to Setup->Termianl to change locale from japanese to english

prompt >>> will be shown.

To show help:
>>> help()

As in help description,

>>> import network
>>> sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF); sta_if.active(True)
>>> sta_if.scan()                             # Scan for available access points
>>> sta_if.connect("<AP_name>", "<password>") # Connect to an AP
>>> sta_if.isconnected()                      # Check for successful connection

will let ESP32 connect an available WiFi access point.

As in tutorial on ESP with MicroPython,
https://micropython-docs-ja.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/esp8266/tutorial/repl.html

>>> import machine
>>> pin = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)
>>> pin.on()
>>> pin.off()

will let LED on GPIO2 turn on/off.

[ampy: File transfer tool on MicroPython]
installed on mingw32 by:
# pip install adafruit-ampy
-> ampy couldn't connect the port perhaps due to Python version (2.7).
   msys pacman has an issue to upgrade Python at the moment.

-> upysh will be used for file transfer or etc. on TeraTerm instead.
